👋 Yodayo~ I’m Giscash0 👋

I am just an ordinary Filipino teenager who started programming for fun.
I also believe that it will be an essential thing in the near future.

I learned the basics of HTML, CSS, and Javascript in 2019.
Then, I studied the fundamentals of C and Java the following year.
Now, I'm searching for free computer science resources where I can learn
about different algorithms and terminologies.

Besides programming, I look into Japanese culture in my spare time.
