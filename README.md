ðŸ‘‹ Yodayo~ Iâ€™m Giscash0 ðŸ‘‹

I am just an ordinary Filipino teenager who started programming for fun.
I also believe that it will be an essential thing in the near future.

I learned the basics of HTML, CSS, and Javascript in 2019.
A year later, I studied the fundamentals of C and Java.
I am currently searching for free computer science resources where I
can learn about different algorithms and terminologies.

Besides programming, I look into Japanese culture in my spare time.
