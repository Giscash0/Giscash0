ðŸ‘‹ Yodayo~ Iâ€™m Giscasho ðŸ‘‹

I am just an ordinary Filipino teenager who started programming for fun.
I also believe that it will be an essential thing in the near future.

I learned the basics of HTML, CSS, and Javascript in 2019.
Then, I studied the fundamentals of C++ and Java the following year.
Now, I'm trying game development using the Godot game engine.

I switched to Ubuntu, a Linux distro to have a better environment.

Besides programming, I look into Japanese culture in my spare time.
